# README for [fgg2go](https://github.com/sfzhu93/fgg2go)

---

This repository hosts [fgg2go](https://github.com/sfzhu93/fgg2go). 
It is a fork of [fgg](https://github.com/rhu1/fgg), and implements two homogeneous translations
of generics, via dictionary passing and dynamic type assertion.

It is part of the artifact of:

> Generic Go to Go: Dictionary-Passing, Monomorphisation, and Hybrid
  
> *Stephen Ellis, Shuofei Zhu, Nobuko Yoshida, Linhai Song"  
> https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06810

The [full artifact](https://zenodo.org/record/7067362#.YzJ-SXbMKUk) is a docker image
that includes a more detailed README and benchmark environment.
